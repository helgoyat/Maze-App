# **Maze Game**

A simple nice-looking maze interface to play with, including various themes.

## Concept

The maze is basically a rectangle filled with emojis. 
When clicking on 'Search' button, the algorithm will search for the shortest path from the lead to the target.

Maze parameters that can be changed through the interface:

* Size (width and height)
* Type of block (path or obstacle)
* The theme
